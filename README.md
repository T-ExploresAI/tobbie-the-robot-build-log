Tobbie the Robot – Build & Debug Log

Overview

This project documents the full assembly, debugging, and successful operation of Tobbie the Robot, an entry‑level robotics kit. The goal of this build was not only to assemble the robot, but to understand mechanical systems, diagnose faults, and document the engineering process clearly.

This README is derived from a detailed engineering-style journal kept during the build (July–December), including photos, observations, failures, fixes, and final success.

Project Goals

Gain hands-on experience with mechanical assembly and gear-driven systems

Practice systematic troubleshooting and fault isolation

Develop clear technical documentation suitable for GitHub

Begin building a visible robotics / engineering learning portfolio

Build Summary

Kit: Tobbie the Robot

Power: AAA batteries

Modes: Obstacle avoidance / Gesture response

Outcome: Fully operational — walking, head rotation, sensor response

Engineering Log (Condensed)

Phase 1 – Initial Assembly

Followed manufacturer instructions step by step

Installed chassis, leg assemblies, gearbox, PCB, sensors, and wiring

Noted early importance of screw tension (too tight vs too loose)


Phase 2 – Power & Electronics Checks

Verified battery polarity and connector seating

Observed LED eye behaviour and startup sounds

Learned correct connector depth and PCB mounting tolerance


Phase 3 – Mechanical Debugging

Robot powered on but failed to walk correctly

Symptoms:

Legs moved when inverted but stalled upright

Audible motor activity with clicking/jumping sounds


Actions taken:

Manually cycled leg mechanisms to assess resistance

Opened gearbox to inspect gear alignment

Corrected mis-positioned leg components

Reinstalled a missing gearbox screw



Phase 4 – Resolution

Identified root cause: gearbox instability due to missing screw + leg misalignment

After correction:

Smooth continuous gear motion

No clicking or gear skipping

Robot able to support its own weight and walk



Result: Successful full operation confirmed 🎉

Reflections

This project reinforced the value of patience, observation, and methodical debugging. Small mechanical details — such as screw placement and gear pressure — can determine whether an entire system succeeds or fails.

Completing this build marked a personal milestone and the start of a hands-on robotics learning path.
